# saasorself – SaaS Cost Optimizer & Custom Tool Readiness Analyzer

**FitCheck** is a strategic lead generation and qualification tool designed for SaaSorSelf, my consulting business helping companies replace bloated SaaS stacks with custom internal tools.

It acts as an intelligent decision engine that evaluates a company's software spend, stack complexity, team capability, and strategic priorities—then delivers a tailored recommendation:  
**Train to build in-house**, **request a custom-built tool**, or **wait until conditions change**.

## 🧠 How It Works

FitCheck is powered by a logic-driven decision tree built on real consulting experience. It cross-analyzes:

- **Monthly SaaS spend**
- **Number and type of tools in use**
- **In-house technical capacity**
- **Integration pain and workflow gaps**
- **Desire for data ownership and long-term control**
- **Tool categories (buildable, risky, or not recommended)**

The system then matches the user to the best-fit path:
- ✅ **Build Internally** – with team training and lightweight custom apps
- ✅ **Done-For-You** – get a high-value tool built fast, without internal devs
- ✅ **Hold Off** – not a fit yet, but keeps the door open for future work

Each outcome includes a conversion-focused, personalized explanation designed to build trust, educate, and lead toward the next step—without ever being pushy.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Advanced Decision Tree Logic**  
  Weighted scoring for tool types, spend tiers, team skill, urgency, and more.

- **LLM-Aware Recommendations**  
  Considers LLM cost per tool (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.) if AI tools are involved.

- **Custom SaaS Cost Database**  
  Integrated database of 50+ SaaS tools with max-tier per-seat pricing for high-accuracy ROI modeling.

- **Lead Magnet Copy Engine**  
  Every result is structured like a soft conversion: educational, specific, and CTA-driven.

- **Fully Contextual Output**  
  Answers adjust tone, depth, and technicality based on the user’s role and team size.

## 🔍 Why It Exists

Most teams overspend on SaaS because they default to “buy” instead of “build.”  
FitCheck flips that assumption by showing the ROI of custom software—without forcing a call or hard sell.

It’s not a quiz. It’s a decision framework that builds trust, provides insight, and qualifies leads with zero friction.
